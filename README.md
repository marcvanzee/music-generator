Automatic generation of sequences of sound in a random key

This simulation creates sequences of tones in a random ground-tone. after setup, x notes fly around at random through the world, making a sound and changing their direction when colliding.
when adding the sequencer, a star will be added to the world, acting as the sequencer. The first note that collides with the sequencer will be the ground-tone of the composition.
every following colliding note that is part of the scale of the ground-tone will be added to the composition.

The user has the possibility to play around with the sequence by changing the tone, the instrument and the speed.
